<p>    Most of the other branches have a 'sticky' FAQ post that always appears at the top of the branch (e.g.   UK and Ireland  ,   Shoestring  ,   Phones, cameras and computers  ) 

<p> 
Now given that there are a few regulars in here who know what they're talking about in regards to long haul travel and also that there's been more than a few disputes about what belongs here and what doesn't maybe it's time instead of bitching at each other about trivial threads (yeah, I'm as guilty of this as anyone) or telling people to use the search button we did something constructive and put together a Long H ...   more inside

<p>   teaching EFL in Marseille, France 

<p>    Hey Guys, 

<p> 
Just wondering if anybody has taught English in Marseille and has some info on good schools. I'm a certified EFL teacher from the States with an EU passport and 2 years experience (Casablanca and Lisbon). Any tip or word of advice on teaching in Marseille (or in France in general) would be greatly appreciated. Likewise, if you are interested in teaching in Morocco or Portugal, I'd be happy to share! 

<p> 
Happy Holidays!

<p>   Home or not? 

<p>    It seems a lot of people have trouble deciding whether to stay or go and I'm no exception. I'm debating about whether or not to go home to Canada for 12 days at the beginning of February. The main argument against this is that its 237 pounds I could be using for something else, like travel to another part of Europe or even just for the January sales happening now. Also the job I have I just started last week and I would need to ask for the time off. Whats pulling me towards home is that I'm a little homesick at the moment, it will be 4 months since I left in February and thats the longest I've ever not seen my family. And I know that they are sad about not having me for Christmas and such. I'm also looking forward to having someone else cook for me. My grandpa also isn't doing that well so I'd like to see him, especially since he gave me 4000 dollars to put towards this trip. I don't really want to travel until its warmer, so I have more time to save up my money again. What do you think? In the immortal words of the clash....Should I stay or should I go?

<p>   A little book worth its weight in gold 

<p>    My younger brother is having a quarter-life crisis, and to inspire him to get out of his funk and stop sponging off our parents, I found a book for him called &quot;Delaying the Real World: A Twentysomething's Guide to Seeking Adventure&quot; by Colleen Kinder. 

<p> 
This is the most comprehensive and current guide to international work and volunteering opportunities I've ever seen. I highly recommend it. It's geared towards Americans, definitely, but would be useful to anyone contemplating a long haul. Too bad I'm not in my twenties anymore...

<p>   Bar/restaurant work in the USA 

<p>    Hi everyone 

<p> 
I'm new here and was just wondering what the chances are of getting work in the USA in bars or restaurants? I am British and live in the UK. Will I need a visa to work less than 90 days or will I need one to work at all? I don't have a job to go to, I'm just interested to see if it's worth going for? 

<p> 
I look forward to your responses. 

<p> 
Many thanks

<p>   work then travel, or travel/work/travel 

<p>    I'm a 21 year old Aussie female, due to arrive in London in Feb, hopefully with savings of around $7000-8000AUD. I'll be on a working holiday permit, with my main aim being to see as much of Europe as possible.  

<p>I'm currently considering finding a job in London immediately, saving some more, then starting some travel when the weather fines up from about May. Do I run the risk of using too much of my initial savings just setting myself up in London?  

<p>Would I be better off getting away from London, travelling around for a bit first then finding a job when the funds run low? This is my first trip overseas. Any tips most welcome!  

<p>Cheers

<p>   support my mind, please 

<p>    Dear LPs, 

<p> 
few month ago I posted the same question, leaving or staying? I did not get a point, I am confused without any plans. Already 4 years ago I had my gap year and travelled through Australia. I loved it, but when I flew home and also spent time in SEA like Cambodia, Thailand and Laos I got the effect of travelling. I cannot stop thinking of going again, I am back into my normal life I am back at the same job - actually things I already wanted to change before I left the first time. With my heart I am always on the way, I know its good for me to go again. On the other side there are my parents, my friends. my kolleques and nobody ever understand me. The put a bad, very bad conscience in my mind. When I turn back of a one year travelling I am 30 and I will never find a job easy. Economic in Germany is getting worse every day, and prices go up every day also. I must be happy of having a save job, today! Thats the opinion of everybody. There are about 15 close people around me and nobody is on my side. Nobody! And I think it brakes my conviction. 

<p>I know this is a traveller forum, and of course you all ganna tell me, Inge go, but is there s ...   more inside

<p>   relatively untouristed places 

<p>    Hey everyone, 

<p>I'm a pretty seasoned traveller (been to 40+ countries on 6 continents) but I'm now looking for more of the places that are less touristed. So far, I've mostly done &quot;the routes,&quot; the standard trails of your average backpacker in various parts of the world. The places I've spent the least time are South America (except Peru) and Africa (except Tanzania and South Africa). I'm curious what places you've come across where you may have been one of the only non-local faces around. No matter what continent or country, what countries (especially) or cities or regions have you visited and found relatively unspoilt by the tourist dollar? 

<p> 
Thanks!

<p>   working in china - visa question 

<p>    I'm thinking of getting a teaching job in China, but worried about making a commitment sight unseen. If I get a work visa, am i then completely bound for the school i teach for? Or could i quit the job and stay in China, working somewhere else or travelling? Could my employer revoke the visa or otherwise get me in trouble?

Worried because there are so many horror stories about English schools in Asia...

<p>    Hi, I have a very basic plan I want to either volunteer/work in central or south america.

My Spanish is non-exsistance but will hopefully be getting betterafter some courses. Has anyone had any dealings with good/bad/indifferent agencies or companies. Any information or advice would be greatly appriated.

<p>   Studying Development studies or modern languages 

<p>    Hi everyone, 

<p> 
I am a 25 year old girl from Germany. I am currently working in the hotel industry here in GErmany, but am not too happy about my situation and am thinking about starting my studies. I would love to study something like Development studies or foreign languages (to become a translater later), especially English and Spanish. I don´t wanna stay in Germany and am thinking about studying in an English speaking country, as it is the only foreign language that I speak and write pretty well (compared to my Spanish skills). At the moment, I am trying to find out, where there are courses that would fit best into my future. I am thinking about the UK, as well as South Africa. (I would love to study in the USA, but I wouldn´t be able to finance it). Can anyone recommend another English speaking country, that I haven´t thought of yet, where I could study things like Development studies or foreign languages. Would be thankful for any general information...:-) Also, any recommendations about universities in the UK or South Africa, considering the subjects, I would like to study?

<p>   The Cambridge Celta 

<p>    Hi all! It's my first post on this branch, so please be gentle. I've been in China for eight years, but am about ready to think of moving on to cleaner pastures. I've got a master's in music education, but have discovered that I really like teaching ESL. One doesn't necessarily need qualifications in China, but if I want to work in other places I'll need something more. I've looked into master's programs, but don't really want to spend a year or so studying. (Another reason is that I don't really want to spend a year or so in the US; I love my country, but I prefer living overseas and visiting for six weeks every winter!) I found a Cambridge Celta program in Thailand that fits my schedule for this summer. The Celta is supposed to be recognized world-wide. It's a four-week intensive program. The cost of the course is US $1,400 or so. The International House Bangkok sponsors it. I'm interested in   the one   in Chiang Mai.  

<p> 
I'm seeking comments on the pros and cons of getting a Cambridge Celta and on my perception that having one will open doors for jobs ...   more inside

<p>   Western Women in Arab Countries 

<p>    Hi there,  

<p> 
I'm an American woman pondering an assignment in Algiers. I am curious to hear the experiences of others in this country or those like it. Comments from solo female expats would be most welcome, but information from anyone who has lived and worked in Algeria as a native or a visitor would help a LOT. It's hard to find a solid body of knowledge anywhere online. 

<p>I have previous expat experience, but it was in Switzerland. It was conservative but I do fear that Maghreb nations may be even more so. Can anyone offer advice on the following: 

<p>- security 

<p>- apartments 

<p>- the chance of mingling with locals (I know no Arabic but plan to study; I am fluent in French.) 

<p>- nightlife 

<p>- English language news/French language news 

<p>- internet availability 

<p>- everyday work life 

<p>- banking and finances 

<p>- dating (does it exist as we westerners know it??)/birth control/sex 

<p>- cost of living 

<p>- clothing, i.e. acceptable dress, where to find clothes and shoes for an average sized woman (US 8-10) 

<p>- local customs and food  

<p>- healthcare, including dental care

I'm very excited about the opportunity but there are just so ...   more inside

<p>   Creative Farewell Present Ideas Needed!! 

<p>    Hey All, 

<p> 
Wasn't sure what branch would be the best to post this on, but seeing as it is about a friend who is moving to the UK indefinitely, thought I'd give it a go here! :) 

<p> 
I have a guy friend who is about to move to London, and I am wanting to give him a farewell gift but I want it to be sorta creative... and I was wondering if anyone had been given (or have given someone else!) a farewell present that was really well received... I need some ideas! 

<p> 
The things that may need to be factored in are... 

<p> 
His age - he is 24 

<p>His nationality - Aussie  

<p>The fact that he has travelled extensively around the world prior to this but that this is his first indefinite move across the oceans (therefore has all the obvious travel equipment) 

<p>And the fact that this gift can't take up too much space as he is attempting to pack his life into the weight limit that the airline has set for regular luggage... 

<p> 
Any ideas will be welcomed!! :) 

<p> 
Thanks
