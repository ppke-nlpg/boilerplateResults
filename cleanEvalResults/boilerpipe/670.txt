<p>Data Sources

<p>The list of references (published and unpublished) used for the assessment and the supporting documentation.

<p>The degree of documentation achieved is extremely variable across the list, but an increasing number of species are meeting the minimum requirements. In a growing number of cases the amount of documentation is substantial, hence to allow users easier navigation through the documentation, the information described above has been grouped under five major headings (Summary, Distribution, Other Documentation, References, Comprehensive) presented as tabs across the top of each Detailed Results page. The Comprehensive tab provides the full documentation for the taxon, whereas the other tabs provide subsets of the information as indicated.

<p>For anyone wishing to submit a Red List assessment for inclusion on the Red List please see the details given under The Red List Assessment Process .

<p>Extinct and Extinct in the Wild Species

<p>For Extinct species (and infra-specific taxa), extra documentation is required  indicating the effective date of extinction, the causes of the extinction and  the details of surveys which have been conducted to search for the species. The  starting date for the inclusion of extinctions was previously set at 1600 AD,  but this has been moved back to 1500 AD to be in line with the starting date  used by the Committee on Recently  Extinct Organisms . An attempt has been made to collate whatever  information is available on each Extinct species and this is presented in the  various documentation fields.

<p>Subspecies, Varieties and Subpopulations

<p>Although the name IUCN Red List of Threatened Species implies that the primary focus is at the species level, the IUCN Red List also  includes assessments that are done at the infra-specific or subpopulation  levels. Ideally, for such taxa to be included in the Red List, the global  status of the species itself should be assessed. In most instances this is the  case and generally these are assessed as Least Concern (LR/lc or LC). There are  some cases, however, especially amongst the plants where this has not been done  and it may well be that some of these species warrant a threatened status. For  subpopulations (also called stocks), only geographically isolated  subpopulations, between which there is little genetic exchange (typically one  migrant individual or gamete per year), are included on the IUCN Red List.

<p>In the 2000 version of the Red List, all searches  produced combined results for species, subspecies, varieties and  subpopulations. In many cases users only wanted species-level information and  if the lists were very long this was often difficult to extract. The default  search options now provide results at the species level only. Searches for  subspecies, varieties and subpopulations have to be specified separately.  If assessments for subspecies, varieties or subpopulations are available, these are clearly indicated from the detailed results pages of the species concerned.

<p>Taxa Removed from the Red List (Synonyms)

<p>The Red List is highly dynamic with species moving on and off for a variety of reasons. The main reasons for removals from the list are changes in taxonomy. All changes are tracked, so that a complete audit trail is kept for each taxon name that ever appears on the Red List. Taxa removed from the Red List for taxonomic reasons (i.e., they are considered synonyms of other taxa) are searchable  (searches will indicate the synonyms found under their accepted/correct names); and the synonym/s are listed on the Detailed Results page for the accepted taxon. The list of synonyms also includes misspellings (orthographic errors).  It is not intended that the IUCN Red List will maintain an exhaustive synonymy for all taxa on the list, however, commonly used synonyms are often included. Any synonyms listed under the taxonomic notes are generally not searchable.

<p>Distribution Information:

<p>Countries and Sub-countries

<p>Distribution is recorded in terms of country names following the 5th edition (and subsequent web updates) of the ISO-3166-1 standard (ISO 1997). Unless geographically very remote from  each other, islands and other territories are included with the parent country.  In the case of species that inhabit islands significantly distant from the  mainland, the island name is given in parentheses (e.g., Spain (Canary  Islands)). The naming of such islands follows edition 2 of the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions (Brummitt et  al. 2001) prepared for the International Working Group on Taxonomic  Databases (TDWG). The TDWG geographic system also provides a standard set of  Basic Recording Units (BRU) that are sub-country units based on provinces or  states. The BRU's are used to subdivide very large countries like Australia,  Brazil, China, South Africa, the Russian Federation and the United States of  America, etc. into smaller more conveniently sized units for recording  distributions. This system has been adopted for the IUCN Red List wherever  possible. Most plant taxa on the Red List have had their distributions recorded  down to BRU level where appropriate, but unfortunately sub-country information  is still lacking for most of the animal species. Hence this feature is not  currently searchable. Each country or territory has also been assigned to a  single geographic region to enable users to search by larger geographic areas.  (View the list of Countries by Regions ).

<p>Geopolitical events during recent years may have led to some inconsistency or errors in the distribution information provided. Within reasonable limits every effort has been made to determine which of the new nations that were part of the former Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and USSR support species previously attributed to the larger unit. There may be some species in the Red List that have still not been fully resolved. Adherence to the ISO system also creates some problems, as there is often a time lag between a political change and a new ISO code being allocated for the new country. The version of the ISO codes used for example, maintains Hong Kong and Macao as separate units.

<p>Doubtful Distributions and Vagrants

<p>The distributions of some species in certain countries  have not been confirmed. These are indicated as possibly doubtful occurrences  by the inclusion of a '?' after the country name. These instances are distinct  from vagrant distributions that are usually displayed  separately with a [vag] or [vag?] flag after the country name. But combinations of doubtful country occurrences and vagrants plus doubtful countries and dubious vagrants are also possible. So care should be taken when using the distribution information for subsequent analyses. Likewise, for a number of very widespread Least Concern taxa, the list of  country occurrences may be incomplete or in some instances not even recorded  (e.g., Mus musculus ) because such taxa are virtually cosmopolitan.  Please note that the results presented in the published analyses of the  Red List data (Baillie et al. 2004, Hilton-Taylor 2000), do not include questionable distribution  records and vagrant distributions. Note that summary  statistics tables do not include any questionable distribution records and records of vagrants, so that the results of any searches on the Red List web site should match the figures in the summary tables.

<p>Aquatic Distributions

<p>For marine species, country records have been provided  wherever possible. This information has been derived from a number of sources,  e.g. FishBase and  the many FAO  publications . Any species without a country name in the Red List is  not included in any of the analyses or tables presented. For some marine  species, especially those that are most strictly marine, their distributions  are also shown as generalized ranges in terms of the FAO Fishing Areas , indicated as follows (e.g., Atlantic-eastern  central). For many inland water species, usually those restricted to a single  water system, inland water ranges are also given with a clear indication from  the name if it is a river or a lake. In a few instances, a second river name  (e.g. Colorado River, Concho River) indicates a section of the drainage in  which the species occurs. In most cases, the countries in which these  freshwater species occur are also recorded, but there are a few instances  (e.g., cichlid fish in Lake Victoria), where the precise country distribution  is unknown, so the only distribution information is the Lake name.

<p>Introductions, Reintroductions and Extinctions

<p>In most cases where a species is known to have been  introduced or reintroduced to a country, this is indicated by an [int] or  [re-int] after the country name in the distribution text. Note that for  searches on threatened species in a specific country or group of countries, the  introduced species are excluded from the results (and also from the summary statistics tables). Whereas a search for a  particular threatened species, will list the countries where it has been  introduced. Where populations are known or suspected to have been extirpated  from a country, this is indicated by [RE] or [RE?] for Regionally Extinct or  possibly Regionally Extinct.

<p>Subpopulations

<p>The Red List contains assessments for some stocks or  geographically isolated subpopulations. In the 1996 Red List these were  indicated by (S) after the species name, but this created confusion in some  cases, so a geographic name is now given directly after the name of the species  e.g., Balaena mysticetus (Spitsbergen stock).
