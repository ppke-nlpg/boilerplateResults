<h>Can you describe a few examples based on questions from                     teachers who use the Learning Page?

<p>Sure...here are a few. The general concepts discussed here                   apply to student and teacher uses.

<p>Is there a difference in fair use guidelines for public,                       non-profit, or private schools?

<p>What's fair use in a public school is probably fair                         use in a non-profit private school. However, the more                         commercial a particular use is, the less likely it is                         to be fair, even if it is educational. Thus, if a commercial                         motive is present, say, for a private, commercial test-preparation                         service, then copying is less likely to be fair despite                         the underlying educational purpose.

<p>A teacher selects a set of 15 photos or other materials                       from the American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the                       Federal Writers' Project, 1936-1940, and makes 5 printed                       copies of this set for small groups to use in a lesson.                       Is there a limit on the number of items in a set, or the                       number of copies that can be made for the lesson?

<p>American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal                           Writers' Project, 1936-1940, was a government-sponsored                           project. It is generally considered to be in the public                           domain as work by government employees. This is also                           the case for material from the Color Photographs                           from the Farm Security Administration and the Office                           of War Information, 1938-1944. This means that                           there is no copyright protection or restriction, thus                           you may copy and freely distribute any number of these                           items.

<p>Because there may be publicity or privacy rights in                         such material, however, you need to make an independent                         assessment of possible legal rights with the assistance                         of the Restriction Statement in the collection. In this                         case there is no limit on the number of permissible items                         in a "set" or the number of permissible copies. Remember,                         this answer is specific to the American Life Histories:                         Manuscripts from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936-1940,                         and Color Photographs from the Farm Security Administration                         and the Office of War Information, 1938-1944. If                         you think the materials might be protected by copyright,                         see the Restriction Statement in each American Memory                         collection.

<p>This lesson will be used in other sections                                   of the same class in the same semester. This                                   is still a one-time use with different students.                                   Is this fair?

<p>As long as the material to be copied is                                     in the public domain, you can copy for one                                     class or many and for one or more semesters.                                     If you wish to use material that is NOT in                                     the public domain, and for which copyright                                     protection exists, then your copying is more                                     likely to be considered fair if it is spontaneous                                     ("Gee, I saw this last night at home on my                                     computer and it would be great for tomorrow's                                     class!"). The more sections and the more                                     semesters you plan to copy particular materials                                     for, the less likely your use is to be considered                                     fair. If you want to use copyrighted material                                     repeatedly, you should obtain permission                                     from the copyright owner.

<p>The lesson will be used by different teachers                                   teaching the same class. Fair?

<p>Again, the more copying that occurs, the                                     less likely the use is to be fair. The less                                     spontaneous the copying is, the less fair.                                     If you are making digital copies or copies                                     that will be available online, it will be                                     less likely to be fair than if you made paper                                     copies, given the potential impact on the                                     copyright owner's market.

<p>This lesson will be used year after year                                   by the same teacher at the same point in the                                   plan of studies for the course.

<p>Lesson planning indicates a systematic planning                                     that is not terribly spontaneous and thus                                     less likely to be fair. If you plan to use                                     the same items year in, year out, think seriously                                     about seeking permission. Document your efforts.                                     You need to make an independent assessment                                     - the Library of Congress makes the American Memory digitized historical collections available                                     for the limited purposes noted in the Restriction                                     Statements. We cannot and do not "warrant" that                                     subsequent uses are fair. Incidentally, copyright                                     owners may be willing to give permission                                     for your use without charge. Once you find                                     an owner, let them know what your specific                                     intention is (who will use it, for what,                                     where, when, how, why - the basics). Always                                     credit sources.

<p>This lesson will be copied for each student                                   in the section of the class.

<p>If the material is in the public domain,                                     copy the materials for each student in the                                     class with no worries. If the work is copyrighted,                                     it is probably fair if you make paper copies                                     for each student in a section of a single                                     class for a single semester. For more on                                     electronic copies, see the next few situations.

<p>A teacher prepares a lesson for a World                                   Wide Web presentation using photographs and                                   documents from the Library of Congress (not                                   linking to them in American Memory).

<p>Because the teacher is placing material                                     on a site where anyone can copy or download                                     the material, the use is less likely to be                                     fair than if the teacher prepares the same                                     lesson for a local area network, or                                     on a stand-alone machine. If material                                     is protected by copyright, it would be wise                                     to get permission for the World Wide Web                                     presentation. Always keep in mind all four                                     of the fair use factors in the Fair Use section of this page.

<p>Students in a project-based curriculum prepare                                   presentations with multiple examples of their                                   topic. How many is too many? How much of a                                   text is too much?

<p>As you know from the above examples, the                                     medium in which the student presents the                                     examples contributes to the fairness of the                                     use. If the examples are placed on a local                                     network for a short period or printed only                                     for class members, it may be fair, depending                                     on a balancing of all Fair                                     Use factors . It is probably not fair                                     to display the same material on a World Wide                                     Web site.

<p>The question of how much is too much is                                     also hard to define. A page or two of a two                                     hundred page novel may be acceptable, though                                     if you copy a particularly significant portion,                                     such as the two pages that make the book                                     marketable (the end of a mystery, for example),                                     you may diminish the market value - which                                     would weigh heavily against one of the fair                                     use factors). A mere two lines from a short                                     poem might also be unfair for the same reason.

<p>A student prepares a multimedia presentation                                   using American Memory resources. How does a                                   student credit sources? Is permission to reproduce                                   materials needed?

<p>Everyone who uses materials from American                                     Memory should credit the American Memory                                     collections of the Library of Congress. See Citing                                     Electronic Sources for suggestions. Further,                                     users should credit particular items and                                     collections which are described in Restriction                                     Statements within the collections. The Library                                     of Congress does not grant or withhold permission                                     to use the materials that are made available                                     online. You must contact the owner for any                                     uses that exceed the limits of fair use.                                     Proper credit is always an indication of                                     good research.

<p>May I link to American Memory? Do I need                                   permission?

<p>If you wish to link to our site, you may                                     do so even without permission as long as                                     your link makes it clear that there is a                                     transition to another site, and that you                                     do not present the link in a way that implies                                     that the Library of Congress or the National                                     Digital Library Program is endorsing a particular                                     product, service, or organization. However,                                     the Library of Congress does like to hear                                     how its site is being used, so please send                                     an email message to the National                                     Digital Library Program mailbox as a                                     courtesy.
