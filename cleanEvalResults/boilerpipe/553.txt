<p>4. Is lupus a fatal                            disease?

<p>Lupus is not a universally fatal disease. In fact, today                            with close follow-up and treatment, 80-90% of the people                            with lupus can expect to live a normal life span. Lupus                            does vary in intensity and degree, however, and there                            are people who have a mild case, there are those who                            have a moderate case and there are some who have a severe                            case of lupus, which tends to be more difficult to treat                            and bring under control. For people who have a severe                            flare-up, there is a greater chance that their lupus                            may be life-threatening. We know that some people do                            die of this disease and because of that we have a tremendous                            amount of respect for the potential of this disease.                            However, the majority of people living with lupus today                            can expect to live a normal lifespan.

<p>People frequently read in the literature that, 80-90%                            of people with lupus live for more than ten years. Unfortunately,                            this is often misinterpreted as- people with lupus live                            for only ten years. Let us clarify this.

<p>It is important to understand that the "10 years" does                            not represent the number of years the person will live,                            but rather the number of years involved in the study.                            The studies followed patients with lupus from the time                            of diagnosis for a period of ten years. At the end of                            this research period they were able to conclude that                            80-90% of the people enrolled were still alive. What                            this study did not look at is what happened in year                            11, 12, 15, 20 and so on. We know there are many people                            who have been living with lupus for 15, 19, 25, 30 and                            40 years. This is not a disease that is universally                            fatal to all. The majority of people with lupus today                            can expect to live a normal lifespan.

<p>When people die of lupus, what do they usually die                            of?

<p>Overwhelming infection and kidney failure are the two                            most common causes of death in people with lupus.

<p>5. Lupus and cancer Is lupus a form of cancer?

<p>No, lupus is not a form of cancer. It is an autoimmune                            disease.

<p>Are people with lupus more likely to develop cancers?

<p>People with lupus are no more likely to develop cancer                            than are people in the general population. However,                            people who have received certain chemotherapy drugs                            do carry the added risk of developing cancer sometime                            later in life.

<p>Are there any special considerations regarding treatment                            of cancer in people with lupus? Cancer can be treated                            in many ways; with surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy.                            All people with lupus who have surgery for cancer, should                            be followed closely by their personal physician and/or                            the rheumatologist to evaluate the activity of their                            lupus throughout the course. For patients receiving                            steroid therapy and surgical procedures, their steroid                            dosage will have to be adjusted during the time just                            shortly before surgery and then tapered slowly over                            time after surgery. If a person is scheduled for surgery                            and they take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs                            or aspirin, any of which may effect their clotting time,                            these medications will need to be stopped prior to surgery                            in order to minimize bleeding.

<p>Chemotherapy usually doesn't present any particular                            problems and can in turn treat active lupus.

<p>6. Is lupus like AIDS?

<p>No. In AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) the                            immune system is under active; it is deficient. In lupus                            the immune system is overactive, producing large quantities                            of antibodies. AIDS is contagious but lupus is not.                            The majority of people diagnosed with AIDS die from                            their disease whereas the majority of people with lupus                            can expect to live a normal lifespan.

<p>7. Lupus anticoagulant

<p>I was just diagnosed with the lupus anticoagulant.                            Does this mean I have systemic lupus?

<p>The lupus anticoagulant is classified as a type of antiphospholipid                            antibody that was first detected in people with lupus.                            It was later learned that many people who do not have                            lupus, also produce these antibodies. In fact, according                            to most studies, greater than 50% of the people who                            have antiphospolipid antibodies, DO NOT have lupus.                            So, just because a person has the lupus anticoagulant                            antibodies does not necessarily mean that they have                            or will develop systemic lupus.

<p>There is a syndrome called the "Primary" Antiphospholipid                            Syndrome (PAPS). This term is used to describe people                            who do not have any signs or symptoms of SLE but produce                            antiphospholipid antibodies such as the lupus anticoagulant                            and/or anti-cardiolipin antibodies and experience problems                            with blood clots, miscarriages, or thrombocytopenia                            (low platelets). People with PAPS do not have lupus.

<p>References: see brochures, Blood                            Disorders in Lupus , and Antiphospholipid                            Antibodies and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

<p>Is it possible to have antiphospholipid antibodies                            and not have systemic lupus?

<p>Yes. Although these antibodies were first discovered                            in people who had lupus, it was later learned there                            are many people who produce these antibodies who do                            not have systemic lupus.

<p>References: see brochures, Blood                            Disorders in Lupus , and Antiphospholipid                            Antibodies and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

<p>Is it possible to have antiphospholipid antibodies and                            not have symptoms related to them, i.e. blood clots,                            miscarriages or low platelets?

<p>Yes. In fact, most people with these antibodies DO NOT                          and will not have symptoms related to them.

<p>8. Lupus and multiple                            sclerosis

<p>I was diagnosed with MS 3 years ago and now my doctor                            thinks I may have lupus. Is there a connection between                            MS and lupus?

<p>Multiple Sclerosis and lupus are both autoimmune diseases.                            They are diagnosed and treated in very different ways.                            There is no direct connection between the two, however,                            lupus, known as a great imposter, can sometimes mimic                            or imitate the symptoms of MS.

<p>My MRI from 3 years ago showed plaques. Is there                            anything on the MRI of people with lupus of the nervous                            system that is diagnostic for CNS lupus?

<p>Diagnosis of CNS lupus is difficult as there is not                            one specific diagnostic test to detect nervous system                            involvement in lupus. The abnormalities seen on the                            MRI scans are not specific for systemic lupus. In other                            words, they could be due to a number of things. The                            findings on these specialized tests and sometimes other                            tests such as a brain wave test (electroencephalogram,                            EEG) and a spinal tap have to be considered along with                            clinical and laboratory findings in establishing a diagnosis                            of CNS lupus.

<p>9. My child has lupus.                            What is the prognosis?

<p>The prognosis for children and adolescents with systemic                            lupus has improved dramatically over the past twenty                            years. With modern therapy, children do nearly as well                            as adults.

<p>LUPUS OF THE SKIN

<p>10. What are the symptoms of cutaneous                            lupus?

<p>The symptoms of cutaneous lupus may include a variety                            of different looking skin rashes, photosensitivity (where                            exposure to ultra-violet light triggers a rash), and                            sometimes ulcers on the inside of the nose or mouth.

<p>Reference: see brochure, Skin Disease and Lupus

<p>What do the rashes look like?

<p>There are a variety of ways that cutaneous lupus rashes                            can appear. The distinctive rash is called the "butterfly                            rash," which is a rash that extends across the cheeks                            of the face and the bridge of the nose. It can be flat                            or raised; it can be bright red or it can be just a                            mild blushing, light pink coloration to the skin. It                            appears on the face in a pattern that looks like a butterfly;                            the wings are beneath both eyes and the body of the                            butterfly covers the bridge of the nose. Here is one                            example of what a butterfly                            rash may look like. (Photo source:                            Dept. of Dermatology, University of Iowa)

<p>Another classic rash found in cutaneous lupus is the discoid rash. This rash is coin-shaped or oval                            in shape, like a disk and it is seen on areas of the                            skin that are exposed to sunlight. Discoid lesions (sores)                            tend to be red and raised and become scaly. When they                            heal they can leave behind a scar. These rashes can                            also result in a change in coloring of the skin, making                            the area around the lesion either lighter or darker                            in color. These discoid lesions may appear on the scalp;                            on the face in a butterfly distribution; or, as mentioned                            earlier, in areas where the skin receives sun exposure,                            especially, for example, the V of the neck. Discoid                            lupus erythematosus (LE) lesions are usually painless                            and typically do not itch. Here is one example of what                            a discoid                            rash may look like. (Photo source:                            Dermatology Information System, Dermis.net)

<p>Chronic cutaneous lupus may also appear in different                            forms including:

<p>verrucous (wart-like) discoid LE

<p>lupus tumidus - elevated areas of red skin with                              no scale or scarring

<p>lupus profundus - discoid skin lesions in conjunction                              with panniculitis

<p>palmar-plantar erosive discoid LE - discoid lesions                              on the hands and feet

<p>Another type of lupus skin rash is classified as the subacute                          cutaneous lesions. These are lesions characterized                          by redness. They are also coin-shaped, very photosensitive                          and they get worse when exposed to ultra-violet light.                          These are lesions that do not leave behind scars, and                          can appear over large areas of the body. People who have                          subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE-a subset                          of cutaneous lupus) may experience systemic symptoms such                          as:

<p>muscle and joint pain,

<p>general discomfort.

<p>Serious kidney or nervous system problems are rare.

<p>These are just a few examples of what cutaneous lupus                            rashes may look like. Because the appearance of skin                            rashes in lupus can be quite variable, it can be difficult                            to diagnose just by looking at the lesion, and therefore                            other tests may be necessary.

<p>Reference: "The Skin In Lupus," by Richard D. Sontheimer,                            M.D. & Thomas T. Provost, M.D. Lupus News, Volume 18,                            Number 2, Spring 1998.

<p>How is cutaneous lupus diagnosed?

<p>Cutaneous lupus, because of the great deal of variability                            in the way that the skin rashes may appear, can be quite                            difficult to diagnose. However, a skin biopsy may be                            performed and this may be diagnostic.

<p>What kind of Doctor specializes in cutaneous lupus?

<p>A dermatologist specializes in diseases of the skin,                            hair and nails. Cutaneous lupus is one of hundreds of                            diseases that involve these areas.

<p>How is cutaneous lupus treated?

<p>Treatment of cutaneous lupus may include corticosteroid                            creams or ointments applied to the rash or lesions.                            If the lesion does not respond to cream or ointment,                            the doctor may prescribe injections of corticosteroids                            directly into the lesion. If a person has particularly                            widespread lesions, oral corticosteroid medications                            may be prescribed or the doctor may prescribe anti-malarial                            medications such as Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine).

<p>In addition to these medications, sunscreens are an                            important part of the prevention of photosensitivity                            (where skin exposed to ultra-violet light reacts by                            developing a rash) reactions that may occur with cutaneous                            lupus lesions.

<p>11. How is cutaneous lupus different                            from systemic lupus?

<p>Cutaneous lupus is confined to the skin, whereas systemic                            lupus may involve not only the skin but any of the other                            organ systems in the body.

<p>Can cutaneous lupus turn into systemic lupus?

<p>In approximately 10% of the cases of cutaneous lupus,                            it evolves and develops into systemic lupus. However,                            this can't be predicted or prevented from happening.

<p>12. I have hair loss due to several                            scars on my scalp. All are about the size of silver                            dollars. Is there anything to help this kind of hair                            loss?

<p>If biopsy results indicate advanced scarring on the                            scalp, then there is little chance of bringing back                            significant amounts of hair. If, on the other hand,                            scarring is not prevalent, then treatment with corticosteroid                            and/or antimalarial drugs may be successful in getting                            the hair to return. When the disease is inactive, and                            scarring is not present hair usually grows back.

<p>Will the drugs used to treat baldness help the hair                            loss due to lupus?

<p>Suppressing the disease with medication helps hair to                            re-grow.

<p>13. Is there anything that can                            be done to cover the lesions (sores) that show-up on                            my face?

<p>Yes. There are make-up products available commercially                            which may be helpful in this situation. Fallene's Total Block® SPF 60 Foundation can be used as a make-up as                            well as a sun block.
