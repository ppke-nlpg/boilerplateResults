<h>THE NINE SOULS OF WILDE CUNNINGHAM, PART I

<p> When wilde Cunningham gets their Second Life sea legs, they'd
 like to build a house. They'd also like to build a castle, though
 not as much as a house, and to a lesser degree, they'd also
 like to run a store. They all seem to like creating note cards,
 however, and also love waterfalls. Some of wilde wants to influence
 the world positively, while at the same time, another part of
 wilde wants to fly a helicopter and get some guns. Another portion
 of wilde would like to be a woman; still another, to make money
 and publish the first part of their life story. More wilde desires:
 to communicate their thoughts with ease, and to be honest about
 their challenges. 

<p>I finally met wilde Cunningham after days of residents enthusing
 to me about them, and truth be told, if I hadnâ€™t known their
 story beforehand, Iâ€™d probably never notice them. Because
 at the moment, wilde is a startling avatar, with their bulky
 body and their orange skin, and red hair jutting in every direction
 from their balding head. 

<p>But there's a very good reason for wilde's appearance, and also
 for their name.

<p>"We decided on our name because we have a group at our program
 which we had to name, some time ago," wilde Cunningham tells
 me. "We took ideas, and then voted on them, and named ourselves
 'the wildes' back then. We have had this name for two years."
 Cunnigham laughs. "Just too wilde to be normal." 

<p>I smile, and they continue: "How did we decide on what we would
 look like, and our gender? We formed the man avatar first, because
 that day, we had more men in the group. We always wanted a female
 one, but we haven't taken the time to create her yet. Mary and
 Johanna would like that very much. We decided on how wilde would
 look first by starting with skin colors. We have both black
 and white in our real life group, and didn't want to have those
 because neither is better than the other. So we picked orange."

<p>And this is probably a good place to introduce wilde in all their
 components-- though maybe their friend lilone Sandgraine is
 the best person to do that here, as she did for me, some days
 before I actually met them in person, as it were.

<p>The people of wilde Cunningham are severely disabled physically
 (but not mentally, not at all), and all but one of them are
 confined to a wheelchair. They owe their Second Life presence
 (though not their essence) to Ms. Sandgrain. In her first life,
 she works with the people of wilde at a care center on the East
 Coast. The idea of getting her clients a Second Life account
 sort of evolved over time-- she doesnâ€™t remember when it finally
 hit her, exactly-- spurred on by her own interest in Second
 Life. (Sheâ€™s been a resident since March of this year.)

<p>"Johnâ€™s key," says lilone. "He has veto powers. Mary, the Queen
 of heart. Micah the Joker. Nichole-- she's shy; she'll hang
 but not talk to ya, unless she knows ya. Scott-- key player.
 Charlene sometimes plays-- still learning the game... very shy,
 but witty like no tomorrow. Danny-- he's cried over Second Life."
 She also tells me about the other John, also shy, and about
 Johanna, who like Micah is a practical joker.

<p>"Sure love these guys," lilone finishes. "They are my heroes.
 Rich treasure chests."

<p>In early December, I got to chat with them in person, near the
 gift shop lilone helped build for them in the snowy region of
 Bretton. 

<p>"Good to finally meet you, wilde!" I say, when they arrive in-world.

<p>"We feel the same way, Hamlet." wilde answers, and shifts their
 feet in the snow. Holiday music is streaming over their property--
 a Bing Crosby song, a Snoop Dogg Christmas rap, and so on. "We
 have been looking forward to meeting you," they continue. "As
 you can see, our typing is even very slow. Sorry."

<p>I tell them they type fine, then ask them how they decide what
 to say.

<p>"Well," they reply, "members of wilde, together with lilone,
 toss out ideas and everyone chimes in when they agree, or chose
 not to answer, which is also OK. Mostly we vote and take group
 census on things. Thatâ€™s what we do-- John G., John S., Scott,
 Mary, Johanna, Danny, and Micah. The others opted out [this
 time], which is fine too."

<p>"I just shared with them about it," she tells me earlier, about
 Second Life. "And knew theyâ€™d love it. I'd share stories of
 my activities here. [To] John and Scott mostly. They love to
 hear such things. John is a hungry sponge. He can't speak as
 such, [but] he's been to college and overseas. But he can't
 ask questions easy. Imagine that. So much to know, and no power
 to ask. He can say 'more' and 'why'. His body won't let the
 [other] words out." 

<p>One response to all the questions they had, even the ones they
 couldn't ask, would be to just show them all what the world
 was like, from their own first-person point of view. 

<p>But even doing wasn't immediately possible. The care center had
 its own various concerns about doing this. It took lilone "lots
 of pulling and tugging," she says, and groans. "Lots of red
 tape and circles." The center had a computer with broadband,
 but it couldn't run the Second Life client without some serious
 hardware upgrades. (But more on that later.) 

<p>Then there was the problem of using an interface. 

<p>"Micah and Charlene could use the mouse," lilone replies, when
 I ask her if it's possible for each member of wilde to enter
 Second Life directly, perhaps with their own individual accounts.
 "John and Nichole could, but wouldn't alone. Micah can't read.
 Charlene has one hand, but can read." She shrugs. "None of them,
 really."

<p>Their solution, for now at least, is lilone effectively acting
 as their interface: she sits at the keyboard, with the wilde
 group gathered in a semi-circle in a cramped care center room,
 peering over her shoulder and into the monitor, at the world
 inside.

<p>Which is where they are now, while we stand there in the snow
 outside their gift shop. Wilde tells me about their experience
 in Second Life thus far (they'd been in-world for nearly a month,
 when we first chat). 

<p>"Some of our favorite people we've met are Toy LaFollette, Angelique
 LaFollette, Baccara Rhodes, Mash Mandella," wilde says. "As
 a group, our favorite experiences are watching Toy make waterfalls,
 meeting new friends, and writing the notecards." In the background,
 Frank Sinatra's cover of "Come All Ye Faithful" is streaming
 over Bretton. 

<p>Their time in-world is short, and with minutes left before they
 need to log off, I ask them if they want to fly with me somewhere,
 for awhile.

<p>"Yes, we can fly," wilde replies, "but following is hard [because
 of] the lag, but we are willing if you are."

<p>I am. So after a few false starts, wilde Cunningham and I take
 to the air.
