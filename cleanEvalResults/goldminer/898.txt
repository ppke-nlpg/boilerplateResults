<p>Poor Nick Coleman, the Minneapolis Star Tribune's worst columnist,
 devotes his entire column in tomorrow's newspaper to attacking
 us. I'd like to respond to his charges, only I can't figure
 out what they are. 

<p>Coleman says we "pursu[e] a right-wing agenda cooked up in conservative
 think tanks funded by millionaire power brokers." If by that
 he means that we're conservatives, we plead guilty. The think
 tank in question appears to be the Claremont Institute, with
 which we have an extremely loose affiliation. And if he means
 to suggest that we share Claremont's respect for the Founding
 Fathers, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution,
 we can only plead guilty once again.

<p>Beyond that, it's hard to say what Coleman's point is, other
 than the fact that he doesn't like us, or, I guess, any other
 conservatives, which is hardly news. This is one of his more
 coherent sentences: "[L]ike talk radio, they are dominated by
 the right and are only interested in being a megaphone without
 oversight, disclosure of conflicts of interest, or professional
 standards." I have no idea what Coleman means by "conflicts
 of interest," and he never provides a hint. As to "professional
 standards," he never cites a single instance in which we have
 misrepresented a source, tried to pass fake documents off as
 genuine, or, for that matter, even made a mistake. So, again,
 it's hard to make much of a substantive response.

<p>Coleman seems to be obsessed with our site, even though we rarely
 mention him. He went so far as to count the number of times
 we "shilled for votes" in the Wizbang Best Blog contest. (I'd
 explain the relevance of this to his tirade, only I don't understand
 it.) It's remarkable that even though he has obviously spent
 a lot of time poring over our site, he cannot identify a single
 substantive error that we have made.

<p>Coleman concludes his tirade, which should be an embarrassment
 to his employers, by purporting to "fact check" us. In the course
 of his "fact check," he says "If I had the money they think
 I do..." Again, I have no idea what in the world he is talking
 about. We have never written anything that suggests we think
 that Nick Coleman has a lot of money. Indeed, speaking for myself,
 I have never spent a single moment thinking about Coleman's
 bank account. Bizarre references like this one have, however,
 caused me to wonder about his mental health. 

<p>Coleman concludes: 

<p>[D]oes Powerline or its mighty righty allies take money from
 political parties, campaigns or well-heeled benefactors who
 hope to affect Minnesota's politics from behind the scenes?
 We don't know, and they don't have to say. They are not Mainstream.

<p>I can't speak for any "mighty righty allies," but as far as we're
 concerned, we don't take any money from any parties, campaigns
 or "benefactors." We don't even have a tip jar. But here is
 what I think is curious: Coleman pretends to be a journalist.
 As such, doesn't he occasionally do research in the course of
 writing his columns? I assume the Strib provides Coleman with
 a desk and a telephone. We publish our telephone numbers on
 this site. Coleman says "we don't know, and they don't have
 to say" whether we get money from parties or campaigns. But,
 Nick, you didn't ask. If you really thought this was a burning
 question that needed to be investigated, why didn't you pick
 up the phone and call one of us? We'd have been happy to fill
 you in.

<p>I'm not surprised, however, that Coleman didn't bother to do
 research to verify his slur against us. He's done the same thing
 before. On December 13, Coleman was a guest host on the far-left
 Air America network; he unleashed a tirade against us. Among
 other things, he described us as paid political operatives--the
 same charge he makes in tomorrow's column. We responded to it
 by writing:

<p>[W]e have, in general, no objection to being paid. On the contrary.
 As it happens, though, we are not being paid by anyone, although
 we do get a little revenue through Blogads. Again, Nick Whoever's
 [we later learned it was Coleman] research skills seem primitive
 at best.

<p>Now, if Coleman were the responsible journalist he claims to
 be, don't you think he would have done a little investigation
 before slandering us again? And, given that we know he scoured
 our site to count the exact number of times we mentioned the
 Wizbang contest, doesn't it seem almost certain that he saw
 the above post--which was, after all, about him--and therefore
 knew that the charge that he makes against us tomorrow was false?

<p>It's been a long time since I went to law school, but I think
 there is a technical term for journalists who make charges that
 they know to be untrue.
