<p>Members of the European Parliament may struggle sometimes to get
 their voice heard inside the European Union, but they’re doing a
 good job of riling their Russian counterparts.

<p>Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the
 state Duma, contrasted the “realistic pragmatic approach” from
 the European Commission to the relationship with Russia to that it
 has with “the ideological institutions like the European Parliament.”

<p>“There are quite a few people in the European Parliament who think
 the more they take decisions that irritate Russia the best it is
 for Europe. I’m not of this opinion.  There is some kind of
 ideological wave which is unfurling over Europe, and it’s a very
 negative wave,” Mr. Pushkov told a group of academics and
 journalists in Moscow.

<p>On Tuesday, the parliament adopted a recommendation calling on EU
 governments to implement sanctions on a list of officials
 responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky, a subsequent 
 judicial cover-up and for the ongoing harassment of his mother and
 wife. The parliament recommended banning those people from entry
 into the  EU, freezing their assets in the EU, and called on
 Russia to launch an independent investigation into his death.

<p>Mr. Magnitsky, a lawyer who before his 2008 arrest was fighting a
 major corruption case, died in a pretrial detention center in 2009
 after complaining he wasn&#8217;t receiving necessary medical
 attention. EU nations haven’t acted but the U.S. barred entry to
 a dozen Russian officials connected to the case in 2011.

<p>This recommendation comes soon after the Pussy Riot punk rock band
 were put on a short list for the annual Sakharov prize awarded
 by the European Parliament for freedom of thought.  The winner of
 the prize, named after the Russian dissident Andrei Sakharov, will
 be announced in December. Two of the three members of the group
 are in jail after staging a protest against Russian president
 Vladimir Putin in a Moscow cathedral.

<p>Awarding the Sakharov Prize to Pussy Riot is “not a great idea,”
 said Mr. Pushkov. “The less they say on these things the best
 it will be,” he said of European parliamentarians. The
 anti-Russian sentiment seemed, he said, to originate in Germany
 where, on a recent visit, he had been told that only people with
 views critical of Russia were allowed to speak on television.
