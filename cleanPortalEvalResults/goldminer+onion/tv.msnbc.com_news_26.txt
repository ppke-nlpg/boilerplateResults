<p>Steve Kornacki took time from preparations for the premiere of Up w/
 Steve Kornacki to send a message to the early risers that take
 to Twitter en masse every weekend. 

<p>Steve Kornacki took time from preparations for the April 13 premiere
 of Up w/ Steve Kornacki to send a message to the early risers
 that take to Twitter to talk serious politics every weekend from
 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.

<p>The #Uppers are an essential part of what makes the show so
 special, and Kornacki knows it. “This is something that sprung
 up because this show means something to so many people who watch
 it,” he said. “They give it some kind of meaning because
 they’re getting some kind of meaning out of the show.”

<p>Watch the video, and watch Up with Steve Kornacki every Saturday and
 Sunday from 8-10.
