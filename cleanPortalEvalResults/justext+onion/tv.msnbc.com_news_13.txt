<p>Lois Lerner, the Director of Tax-Exempt Organizations at the Internal
 Revenue Service, has been placed on administrative leave. The IRS
 announced that Ken Corbin will now serve as acting director.

<p>The IRS’ new Acting Commissioner Daniel Werfel asked Lerner to
 resign. When she refused, she was then placed on administrative
 leave, according to NBC News.

<p>Lerner was the first agency official to publicly acknowledge the
 current controversy when she responded to a question at a
 conference on May 10. The IRS has been under fire for giving
 special scrutiny to self-identified conservative groups.

<p>Lerner has been under fire since invoking her 5th amendment
 rights Wednesday to avoid answering questions during a House
 Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on the matter.

<p>“I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws. I
 have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not
 provided false information to this or any other congressional
 committee,” she said at the hearing. “While I would very much
 like to answer the committee’s questions today, I’ve been
 advised by my counsel to assert my constitutional right not to
 testify or answer questions related to the subject matter of this hearing.”

<p>Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, a senior member of the Finance
 Committee with Senate jurisdiction over the IRS, was quick to
 defend Werfel’s request for Lerner’s resignation.

<p>“The IRS owes it to taxpayers to resolve her situation quickly,”
 he said in a statement. “The agency needs to move on to fix
 the conditions that led to the targeting debacle. She
 shouldn&#8217;t be in limbo indefinitely on the taxpayers&#8217; dime.”
