<p>Why are we surprised by Rep. Todd Akin’s appalling statement
 distinguishing which rapes are &#8220;legitimate&#8221;? Why are we
 surprised that Akin, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate
 from Missouri, thinks that victims of “legitimate rape” don’t
 get pregnant because “the female body has ways to try to shut
 that whole thing down?” And why are we surprised that he wants
 to outlaw abortion even in the case of rape?

<p>Disgusted? Of course. But surprised? We already had clear evidence of
 what Akin believes from his record. Just last year, he joined
 Paul Ryan and more than 200 other House Republicans in
 co-sponsoring legislation that would have narrowed which types of
 rape victims could benefit from financial assistance to access
 abortion services. The bill would have cut off victims who were
 drugged or threatened, some victims of incest, and victims of
 statutory rape—victims who, it appears, don&#8217;t fall into
 Akin&#8217;s definition of &#8220;legitimate&#8221; rape victims. As
 for the belief that women don’t need access to abortion when
 “legitimately raped” because their bodies will prevent a
 pregnancy, that&#8217;s not just some feverish product of
 Akin&#8217;s mind—it&#8217;s a widely held belief in radical
 anti-choice circles across the country.

<p>What’s more surprising is that Akin, along with Mitt Romney and
 Ryan, think they can run away from their record and fool the
 women of this country by offering vague apologies and calculated
 statements in the wake of a controversy like this. Whether a
 woman has the ability to make her own health care
 choices—including in the case of rape—is not something that our
 elected officials should be changing their positions on to suit
 the political climate. These are fundamental ethical questions that
 no person of conscience changes position on lightly. Either you
 firmly believe in protecting women or you don’t.

<p>Akin at first tried to defuse the controversy by saying he merely
 “misspoke.” And Romney and Ryan are working overtime to
 distance themselves from Akin’s remarks. But the records tell a
 different story: All three have previously gone on record as
 supporting outlawing all abortions, including in the case of rape,
 and have taken actions to match.

<l>As Massachusetts governor, Romney vetoed a bill to guarantee victims
 of rape access to emergency contraception in hospital emergency rooms.

<l>Romney has repeatedly endorsed the 2004 and 2008 Republican Party
 platforms, and has specifically backed the platform&#8217;s Human
 Life Amendment to ban abortion nationwide, which has no exceptions
 for rape and incest. A similar measure is set to be included in
 the 2012 platform, to be adopted next week.

<l>Romney has said that he now has the same positions that he had
 when he previously ran for president, and said that he would be
 “delighted” to sign a bill to outlaw ALL abortions.

<l>In 2011, Ryan co-sponsored a bill that declared a fertilized egg
 that hasn&#8217;t even resulted in a pregnancy to be the
 equivalent of a living person, with all of the rights of federal
 law. That bill criminalized all abortion with no exceptions for rape.

<p>Of course, Romney and Ryan have muddied the waters by at times
 allowing exceptions to their anti-choice stance. But as a wise
 woman, Lilly Ledbetter, once warned me, we must always look to an
 elected official’s record, never simply to politically opportune
 statements. Actions always speak louder than words.

<p>Although we shouldn’t have been surprised by Akin’s awful
 statement, we must be forewarned that if elected, Romney and Ryan
 will continue their extreme and dangerous record on women’s health.
