<p>Lois Lerner, the Director of Tax-Exempt Organizations at the Internal Revenue Service, has been placed on administrative leave. The IRS announced that Ken Corbin will now serve as acting director.

<p>The IRSâ€™ new Acting Commissioner Daniel Werfel asked Lerner to resign. When she refused, she was then placed on administrative leave, according to NBC News .

<p>Lerner was the first agency official to publicly acknowledge the current controversy when she responded to a question at a conference on May 10. The IRS has been under fire for giving special scrutiny to self-identified conservative groups.

<p>Lerner has been under fire since invoking her 5th amendment rights Â Wednesday to avoid answering questions during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on the matter.

<p>â€œI have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee,â€ she said at the hearing. â€œWhile I would very much like to answer the committeeâ€™s questions today, Iâ€™ve been advised by my counsel to assert my constitutional right not to testify or answer questions related to the subject matter of this hearing.â€

<p>Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, a senior member of the Finance Committee with Senate jurisdiction over the IRS, was quick to defend Werfelâ€™s request for Lernerâ€™s resignation.

<p>â€œThe IRS owes it to taxpayers to resolve her situation quickly,â€ he said in a statement. â€œThe agency needs to move on to fix the conditions that led to the targeting debacle. She shouldn’t be in limbo indefinitely on the taxpayers’ dime.â€
