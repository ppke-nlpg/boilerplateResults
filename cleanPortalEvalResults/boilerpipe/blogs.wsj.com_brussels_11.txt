<p>Members of the European Parliament debate at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.

<p>The European Union has a long history of dumping mountains of cash on communications projects in an effort to:

<p>Make itself more popular and better known among EU citizens. This has led to such campaigns as â€œEurope is Bling,â€ an online trivia game hosted by a (fictional) white European rapper named Mr. Bling who rapped “Me like Europe. Europe is bling. Bling!” Last year, there was â€œCan EU hear me?,â€ an effort to promote lagging participation in elections to the European Parliament through mass gatherings of young people in sexy European capitals.

<p>Educate Europeans about the mysteries of its functioning and process. Thus the births of the EUâ€™s YouTube channel and European Parliament television .

<p>One way of doing both, EU officials say, is to develop video games , such as Euro Kidsâ€™ Corner .

<p>Enter a half-dozen Brussels-based media and communication companies who derive all or a substantial part of their profits from the EUâ€™s â‚¬268 million annual communications budget. One of them, the European Services Network , has received a â‚¬275,000 contract to develop and online Second Life-style interactive game called Citzalia .

<p>The game will take players through the hallways of European Parliament offices in Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg. As is the tradition in such pastimes, players can use their avatars to do everything from choosing flowers and furniture to debating the effects of climate change.

<p>It’s still in its developmental stage, ESN says. You, dear EU political junkie, can now take part and offer feedback. ESN staff say the game is not designed for gaming teenagers but for serious students of EU policy.

<p>UPDATE: Ahmed ElAmin, the siteâ€™s project editor, called to clarify a few points about Citzalia. â€œPeople are calling it a game,â€ he says. â€œBut itâ€™s not, itâ€™s a simulation of how the parliament works and a forum for readers to debate ideas about the parliament and the EU.â€

<p>ESN is paying a quarter of the costs and is using the project as a kind of marketing venture, he adds. â€œWeâ€™re not making any money from this. We want to show the skills and thinking outside the box that weâ€™re capable of.â€
