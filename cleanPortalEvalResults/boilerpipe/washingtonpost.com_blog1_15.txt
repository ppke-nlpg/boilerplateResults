<p>The Postâ€™s mobile Web site Â has come a long way since we launched last summer . Weâ€™ve experimented with storm trackers, election maps and Instagram widgets and have worked to keep adding functionality as we go.

<p>Our latest release includes one of the featuresÂ you’veÂ been asking for: the ability to read comments. These are the exact same comments you can see on washingtonpost.com. We will offer the ability to write comments via mobile within the next two weeks.

<p>As always, please feel free to e-mail mobilewebfeedback@washingtonpost.com with your comments and suggestions on the mobile Web.

<p>Thanks for reading!

<p>Julia Beizer is The Post’s mobile projects editor.
