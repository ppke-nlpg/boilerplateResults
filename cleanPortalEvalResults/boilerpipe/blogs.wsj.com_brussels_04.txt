<p>U.S. ambassador Howard W. Gutman is something of a celebrity in Belgium, thanks to hisÂ plan to visit every single one of the countryâ€™s 589 towns . While the chocolate-box charms of Bruges, Ghent and Antwerp are well known, heâ€™s been going further afield as well.

<p>Early in his tour, he went to Charleroi in the countryâ€™s French-speaking south. Best known for its post-industrial decline â€“ a phenomenon shared with its twin city of Pittsburgh â€“ the ambassador was keen to see another side of the city, including the largest photography museum in Europe , which has an impressive collection of iconic photos from the U.S.

<p>â€œHe came to visit and met students, answered all their questions, even controversial ones about Iraq and Israel, and it was a huge PR boost for the town, in particular the photography museum,â€ Antoine Tanzilli, the head of tourism at Charleroiâ€™s city hall recalls. â€œI was really stunned by the size of his security operation, he had much more security than the King when he came to visit.â€

<p>His grand tour has so far included the Lotus bakeries biscuit factory, Mardi Gras in Malmedy, and several breweries â€“ as well as AB-InBev heâ€™s been to a host of smaller ones including Bosteels , home of Tripel Karmeliet (brewed by nuns as opposed to monks) and even Westvleteren, home of the extremely rare , very delicious brew of the same name.

<p>Just before Christmas, Gutman went to Bastogne, scene of one of the U.S. Armyâ€™s bloodiest battles in World War II. He joined dignitaries, and the last couple to married there that year, on the town hall balcony to throw walnuts at the crowd in a ceremony with disputed roots â€“ some believe it has existed since medieval times, while others say itâ€™s based on General McAuliffe’s response of “Nuts!” a Nazi demand for surrender during the the battle.

<p>â€œHe came on the walk of remembrance round the memorial site, itâ€™s not the first time heâ€™s joined us for the ceremony,â€ Jocelyne Olivier, the town councilor responsible for the event says. â€œHis nut-throwing technique gets better every year. He said heâ€™d been taking baseball lessons–they went very far indeed!â€

<p>His fondness for the country where President Barack Obama posted him is reflected in his quirky approach to speechwriting. â€œIf Barack Obama Were A Country, Heâ€™d Be Belgium,â€ he said recently. â€œAnd as with Barack Obama, when you are discussing Belgian creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship, you need note only “Yes We Can.’”
