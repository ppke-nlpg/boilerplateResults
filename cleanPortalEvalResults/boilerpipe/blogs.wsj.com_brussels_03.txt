<p>JosÃ© Manuel Barroso has just said it: The European Commission “will examine closely the relevance of banning purely speculative naked sales on credit default swaps of sovereign debt.” That would stop people buying CDS on Greek or Spanish debt unless they owned the debt. See previous post for an explanation.

<p>“It is not justified to buy an insurance… on a purely speculative basis,” he said.

<p>“If it is true that the current problems in Greece were not caused by speculation on the financial markets, it is also true that this speculation was an aggravating factor,” Mr. Barroso said.

<p>While the mood in Europe seems to be to go ahead anyway, Mr. Barroso notes that it would be better if the move was done jointly with the U.S. and others through the Group of 20 leading economies. “The Commission will push for international coordination. These markets are as mobile as they are opaque. The Commission will raise this question with our international partners, notably at the level of the G-20.

<p>More cryptically, he raised an approach to financial regulation that is being increasingly discussed in the corridors in Brussels: using competition policy to deal with the financial markets. That is one area of policy that the commission can decide upon itself, without reference to politicians or the European Parliament.

<p>On the live issue of a European monetary fund, Mr. Barroso said the commission is working on “a mechanism which Greece could use in case of need,” that would be in conformity with the current Lisbon Treaty and with the clause forbidding governments from bailing out each other. This would require the support of euro area member states.

<p>This suggests, as commission officials hinted yesterday, that he thinks a bailout mechanism is possible without opening up any new treaty and with the agreement just of the 16 members of the euro zone (and possiblyÂ a qualified majority) instead of the full EU membership of 27.
