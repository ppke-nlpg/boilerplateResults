<p>Dear readers,

<p>Weâ€™re excited to roll out to you an all-new version of our flagship iPad app , one that provides a top-of-the-line news app experience for our journalism.

<p>We’veÂ built out the best of everything on our Web site and included all of the journalism in our printed paper. You can now have the complete digital and print Washington Post wherever you go. With a richly designed reading experience, weâ€™re now bringing you a replica of the printed newspaper, along with a 14-day archive, over 40 comic strips, all Post blogs and real-time social. The app gives you video, photo galleries, new search functionality and offline reading — a bonus for travelers and commuters without a live Internet connection.

<p>Another feature weâ€™re proud of is The Forum, a tool that makes it easy for iPad users to identify, organize and customize conversations on Twitter. In addition to our already popular political Forum,Â we’veÂ added a D.C. area sports Forum featuring tweets from athletes, sports figures and local media.

<p>The Washington Post app for iPad is available as a complimentary subscription to all users until the app becomes part of The Postâ€™s new digital subscription model, launching in the summer of 2013.

<p>You can download it here .

<p>Thank you for reading The Post in print and online.Â We look forward to delivering it to you on the iPad.

<p>Marty Baron is Executive Editor of The Washington Post.
