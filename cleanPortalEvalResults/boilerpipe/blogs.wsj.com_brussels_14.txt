<p>Members of the European Parliament may struggle sometimes to get their voice heard inside the European Union, but theyâ€™re doing a good job of riling their Russian counterparts.

<p>Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the state Duma, contrasted the â€œrealistic pragmatic approachâ€ from the European Commission to the relationship with Russia to that it has with â€œthe ideological institutions like the European Parliament.â€

<p>â€œThere are quite a few people in the European Parliament who think the more they take decisions that irritate Russia the best it is for Europe. Iâ€™m not of this opinion.Â  There is some kind of ideological wave which is unfurling over Europe, and itâ€™s a very negative wave,â€ Mr. Pushkov told a group of academics and journalists in Moscow.

<p>On Tuesday, the parliament adopted a recommendation calling on EU governments to implement sanctions on a list of officials responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky, a subsequentÂ  judicial cover-up and for the ongoing harassment of his mother and wife. The parliament recommended banning those people from entry into the Â EU, freezing their assets in the EU, and called on Russia to launch an independent investigation into his death.

<p>Mr. Magnitsky, a lawyer who before his 2008 arrest was fighting a major corruption case,Â died in a pretrial detention center in 2009 after complaining he wasn’t receiving necessary medical attention. EU nations havenâ€™t acted but the U.S. barred entry to a dozen Russian officials connected to the case in 2011.

<p>This recommendation comes soon after the Pussy Riot punk rock band were put on a short list for the annual Sakharov prize awarded by the European Parliament for freedom of thought. Â The winner of the prize, named after the Russian dissident Andrei Sakharov, will be announced in December. Two of the three members of the group are in jail after staging a protest against Russian president Vladimir Putin in a Moscow cathedral.

<p>Awarding the Sakharov Prize to Pussy Riot is â€œnot a great idea,â€ said Mr. Pushkov. â€œThe less they say on these things the best it will be,â€ he said of European parliamentarians. The anti-Russian sentiment seemed, he said, to originate in Germany where, on a recent visit, he had been told that only people with views critical of Russia were allowed to speak on television.
