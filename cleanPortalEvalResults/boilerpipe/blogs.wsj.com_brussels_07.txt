<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy gestures while speaking during a final press conference at an EU summit in Brussels on Saturday.

<p>Was Friday the day the governments of the euro zone realized the scale of the threat that confronts the common currency? If the language used after the summit of euro-zone leaders is any guide, the answer is yes. And the extraordinary promise to create a mechanism to save the euro zone and impose costs on speculators — details to come after finance ministers and others meet on Sunday — also suggested yes.

<p>Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, said the euro zone was facing the most serious crisis since its creation. “The crisis is systemic; the response must be systemic,” he said.

<p>Months of delays in putting together a Greece bailout package, in which the euro zone’s crisis went from bad to worse, were suggesting to many observers, not least in Washington , that Europe’s political leaders had neither the will nor the way to stop the crisis in its tracks.Â In the early hours of Saturday morning, the leaders emerged from their meeting and said: “Yes, we can.” Whether in fact they can remains to be seen.

<p>It’s worthÂ summing up just what was happening in the financial markets in past week which hasÂ stirred the leaders of Europe. Against a backdrop of riots in the streets of Athens, yields on the bonds of other euro-zone governments in southern Europe climbed alarmingly. Yields on Portuguese two-year bonds rose above 8%, on a par with Greek government bond yields justÂ a few weeks ago, indicatingÂ real default concerns.Â Stories started swirling around that some banks couldn’t find buyers for Italian government bonds. As the euro sank,Â anxieties grew about European banks, manyÂ of which are big holders of government bonds. It began to look like the second phase ofÂ the crisis that began with subprime in the U.S.

<p>According to Mr. Sarkozy, a group of leaders arrived early in Brussels on Friday to talk about what needed to be done. He, Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, Angela Merkel of Germany,Â JosÃ© Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain, JosÃ© Socrates of Portugal met with Herman Van Rompuy, the European Union president, JosÃ© Manuel Barroso, the head of the European Commission, and Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank chief, in caucus before the full summitÂ that took place over dinner.

<p>Mr. Sarkozy said the emergency mechanism would be ready by the time the markets opened Monday morning and wouldn’t require changes to EU treaties, clearly recognizing that such delaysÂ would be a signalÂ to resume the assault on the euro-zone’s markets. The ministers’ job Sunday would be to “finalize the technical modalities” of the package, he said, an unfortunate echo of a phrase we often heard earlier in the crisis.

<p>What is contemplated? One possibilityÂ is direct borrowing by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, which would be guaranteed by European nations. A similar structure was used in earlier bailouts of non-euro-zone countries such as Hungary — though a different mechanism would have to be used to help a euro-zone government.Â A fund financed in this way could, some analysts say, buy government bonds. What size would this need to be?Â The only answer would seem to be: Very big.

<p>This raises a lot of questions. According to the summit declaration, the meeting Sunday is of the finance ministers of the 27 states of the EU — not just the 16 euro-zone members. Mr. Sarkozy spoke of a decision being made, if necessary, using qualified majority voting–suggesting that if any opposition came fromÂ  governments outside the euro-zone,Â they might find themselves outvoted.Â It is not clear either whetherÂ the non-euro governments — including the current government-in-limbo of the U.K. — would be expected to make a financial contribution.

<p>Moreover, Germany’s view of all this remains to emerge even though Mr. SarkozyÂ insisted that he and Ms. Merkel were at one. As he gave his press conference on a stage bedecked by eurozone flags, the German chancellor exited quietly. Perhaps more European bailout talk is not what she needs ahead of Sunday’s regional election in North Rhine-Westphalia.

<p>Other elementsÂ could also emerge in coming days. To help the banks, it is possible that the European Central Bank will announce it’s willing to provide more one-year money to banks, replacing a program that rolls off in July. (The prospect of the ECB itself buying government bondsÂ may not be efficient if the idea is to help ease sovereign debt worries, given the central bank appears to be unable to target the markets in which it intervenes, as explained here .)

<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve could provide dollars to Europe at some point if it felt that there were shortages. Meanwhile, the board of the International Monetary Fund meets Sunday to sign off on its contribution to the Greece bailout.

<p>In their story on Washington’s concerns about events in Europe, my colleagues Bob Davis and Jon Hilsenrath say this:

<p>Both Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House economist Lawrence Summers like to quote former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo as saying: “Markets overreact — and that means policy has to overreact.”

<p>Interesting to hear Mr. Sarkozy echoing that in the early hours of Saturday morning. The euro zone is facing â€œan exceptional situation,” he said,Â ”to which we have toÂ bring an exceptional response.â€ Quite how exceptional we should be able to judge in the next 48 hours.
