<p>Members of the European Parliament debate at the European Parliament
 in Strasbourg.

<p>The European Union has a long history of dumping mountains of cash
 on communications projects in an effort to:

<l>Make itself more popular and better known among EU citizens. This
 has led to such campaigns as “Europe is Bling,” an online
 trivia game hosted by a (fictional) white European rapper named
 Mr. Bling who rapped &#8220;Me like Europe. Europe is bling.
 Bling!&#8221; Last year, there was “Can EU hear me?,” an
 effort to promote lagging participation in elections to the
 European Parliament through mass gatherings of young people in sexy
 European capitals.

<l>Educate Europeans about the mysteries of its functioning and process.
 Thus the births of the EU’s YouTube channel and European
 Parliament television.

<p>One way of doing both, EU officials say, is to develop video games,
 such as Euro Kids’ Corner.

<p>Enter a half-dozen Brussels-based media and communication companies who
 derive all or a substantial part of their profits from the EU’s
 €268 million annual communications budget. One of them, the
 European Services Network, has received a €275,000 contract to
 develop and online Second Life-style interactive game called Citzalia.

<p>The game will take players through the hallways of European
 Parliament offices in Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg. As is
 the tradition in such pastimes, players can use their avatars to
 do everything from choosing flowers and furniture to debating the
 effects of climate change.

<p>It&#8217;s still in its developmental stage, ESN says. You, dear EU
 political junkie, can now take part and offer feedback. ESN staff
 say the game is not designed for gaming teenagers but for serious
 students of EU policy.

<p>UPDATE: Ahmed ElAmin, the site’s project editor, called to clarify
 a few points about Citzalia. “People are calling it a game,”
 he says. “But it’s not, it’s a simulation of how the
 parliament works and a forum for readers to debate ideas about
 the parliament and the EU.”

<p>ESN is paying a quarter of the costs and is using the project as
 a kind of marketing venture, he adds. “We’re not making any
 money from this. We want to show the skills and thinking outside
 the box that we’re capable of.”
