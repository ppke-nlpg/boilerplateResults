<h>#Click3: The greatest from the world wide web

<h>Share this with friends

<p>Mother Jones offers a great graphic that answers the question “Is
 your team’s owner a ‘Major League A-hole?”; Mark Bittman has
 a great New York Times piece about the healthy fast food
 movement; and BuzzFeed has a great list out telling you who the
 hottest attorneys general are.

<p>The All In with Chris Hayes team puts out a daily call to the
 Twitter and Facebook communities for the “awesomest things” they
 encountered on the Internet.

<p>1.  Following a ruling that determined the New York Yankees baseball
 team has the exclusive rights to the phrase &#8220;Baseball&#8217;s
 Evil Empire,&#8221; Mother Jones undertook the admirable effort to
 document the owners of all major league baseball teams, which
 resulted in &#8220;Is Your Team&#8217;s Owner a Major League
 Asshole?&#8221; The matrix makes the Yankees, in spite of their
 trademark, look like kittens.  Thanks to Twitter fan Jennie Brand
 who pointed us to this.

<p>2. New York Times writer Mark Bittman, in his latest column, has
 documented the efforts of small fast food chains to offer their
 customers healthy, humane, and cheap food.

<p>3. Buzzfeed seized on President Obama&#8217;s remarks concerning the
 physical appearance of California&#8217;s attorney-general Kamala
 Harris. We didn&#8217;t know what we were missing until
 Buzzfeed&#8217;s Rosie Gray compiled The 13 Hottest Attorneys-General.
